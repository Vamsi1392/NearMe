    <h2 style="font-family: serif;">The deity is believed to be as old as the "Shila thoranam" in Tirumala. 
        Tirumala has tremendous fame from the ancient period. The deity is referred to as 'Balaji' by North Indians. 
        The scriptures state that Venkateshwara is the saviour of all suffering people in the Kali Yuga.
